- increased nfft to avoid truncation the default is `512`

- Fourier transform is a mathematical formula that transforms a signal sampled in `time or space` to the same signal sampled in `temporal or spatial frequency.`


### Look into:
- extract the label: __main__ fnx: main.ipynb: HMM

ValueError: Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead:
array=[].
Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.

* Fit expects a 2D array.
